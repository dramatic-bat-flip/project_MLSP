Our results can be observed through the outputs of the attached notebooks. Reproducing our results can be simply achieved by re-executing the notebooks. The fine-tuned models are saved locally and can be shared upon demand, but are too big to be uploaded to this repo.

The Idefics2 folder contains all the notebooks associated with the Idefics2 model. `Idefics2_eval.ipynb` is the notebook that contains the code to compute the accuracy of a fine-tuned Iedfics2 model on the test dataset. The other notebooks in the folder all fine-tune Idefics2 in different ways.

The LLaVA-1.5 folder contains all the notebooks associated with the LLaVA-1.5 model.  `llava_eval.ipynb` is the notebook that contains the code to compute the accuracy of a fine-tuned LLaVA-1.5 model on the test dataset.
